# Cryptography
## Overview
Cryptography Implementation
I strongly referenced the book, 'Understanding Cryptography'(https://www.crypto-textbook.com/) and the lecture('Introduction to Cryptography by Christof Paar', https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos).

1. Data Encryption Standard, DES
 - I used 'BitVector' libray for implementing DES. I think it is the perfect library for bit operation. Even though the library provides very powerful functions, I do not use them for deeper understanding DES. 

## How to start
This project was coded in Python 3.8.9
 * BitVector (https://pypi.org/project/BitVector/) for '1. DES'
